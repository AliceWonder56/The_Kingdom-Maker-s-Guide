A palace is a grand and splendid seat of government for your leaders and other political functionaries.

**Lots** 4; **Cost** 108 RP, 20 Lumber, 12 Luxuries, 15 Ore, 20 Stone  
**Construction** [Defense](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=21) (master), [Industry](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=25) (master), [Magic](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=27) (master), or [Statecraft](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=30) (master) DC 34  
**Upgrade From** [[Castle]]  
**Item Bonus** +3 item bonus to New Leadership, [[Pledge of Fealty]], and [[Send Diplomatic Envoy]], and +3 item bonus to [[Garrison Army]], [[Recover Army]], or [[Recruit Army]] (see Appendix 3: Warfare)  
**Effects** A palace can only be built in your capital. The first time you build a palace, reduce Unrest by 10.  
If you [[Relocate your Capital]], a palace left behind in that capital instead functions as a noble villa that takes up 4 lots. (If you represent this by placing two noble villas in these lots, make sure to note that they constitute a single building and aren't two separate structures.)  
A palace in a capital allows PC leaders to take 3 Leadership activities during the Activity phase of a Kingdom turn rather than just 2. In addition, once your kingdom has a palace, a PC in the Ruler leadership role gains a +3 item bonus to checks made to resolve Leadership activities.
