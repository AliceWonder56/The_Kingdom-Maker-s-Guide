Unrest represents unhappiness among the kingdom's citizens, who show their lack of confidence in the leadership by balking at edicts, refusing to follow commands, and disrupting local economies through boycotts, walkouts, and refusal to talk to emissaries. Unrest is a persistent value that remains from turn to turn and can be adjusted during Kingdom turns as events play out.
