All kingdoms have leaders who fill roles tending to the economy, defense, and health of its citizens. Each role grants the kingdom different benefits, provided a character—be it a PC or an NPC—takes up the mantle of serving in that role. A character can only fill one leadership role at a time, but it’s important to have all eight roles filled, for when a kingdom goes without a leader, problems arise.

If unexpected events (such as the death of a character) remove a leader from a leadership role, the [[New Leadership]] kingdom activity (page 24) may immediately be used to assign a new leader to that role—even outside of a Kingdom turn.

Each character in a leadership role (whether PC or NPC) must spend a week of downtime activity each month attending to their duties (though these seven days need not be consecutive). This downtime works just the same as time spent retraining a feat or skill; a character can take multiple downtime activities during the course of a month as time allows. A character can attend to their duties even if they take on a downtime activity with a longer time requirement (such as retraining a class feature, which requires at least a month); in this case, simply break up the time required for that longer activity over the course of consecutive months, leaving seven days during each month for leadership activities. NPCs assigned to leadership roles are presumed to meet the downtime requirement automatically unless the PCs deliberately have them step away from the job (likely to accompany them on adventures). If a character does not spend this downtime, at the start of the [[Upkeep phase]] of the next Kingdom turn (page 43), they either incur their role’s vacancy penalty (see below) or lose one of their leadership activities for that turn.

There is an advantage to assigning a leadership role to a PC rather than an NPC. Each kingdom event specifies a leader, and if that leader is a PC who is not incurring a vacancy penalty, the kingdom receives a bonus to the kingdom check that determines the event’s outcome.

Some benefits require that a role be invested. In step 7 of Kingdom Creation (page 14), the players select 4 leadership roles to be invested; at the start of each Kingdom turn, they may reselect the roles that are invested (see Leadership Roles). Note that when certain companions detailed in the Kingmaker Companion Guide hold the leadership roles listed in their entry in that book, those roles are automatically invested; this is in addition to the four roles the players choose to invest.
