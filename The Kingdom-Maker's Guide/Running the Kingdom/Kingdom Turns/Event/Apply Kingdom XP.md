The GM now awards any kingdom XP earned during that turn. If the kingdom experienced a random event, it receives 30 XP. The first Kingdom turn that your kingdom spent 100 RP, gain 80 kingdom XP as a [milestone award](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1816).  
  
In addition, any RP that remains unspent is now converted to kingdom XP on a 1 to 1 ration, to a maximum of 120 XP per Kingdom turn.
