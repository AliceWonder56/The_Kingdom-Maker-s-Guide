As your kingdom levels up and your settlements grow, a settlement's type can change, providing different benefits and costs to your kingdom (see the table and descriptions below).

## Settlement Types

|**[[Settlements]]**|**[[Size]]**|**[[Population]]**|**[[Level]]**|**[[Consumption]]**|**[[Max. Item Bonus]]**|**[[Influence]]**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Village (1st)|1 block|400 or less|1|1|+1|0|
|Town (3rd)|4 blocks|401–2,000|2–4|2|+1|1 hex|
|City (9th)|9 blocks|2,001–25,000|5–9|4|+2|2 hexes|
|Metropolis (15th)|10+ blocks|25,001+|10+|6|+3|3 hexes|

### Capital bonus: 
The Capital is allowed to grow one (and only one) size Category bigger than the normal restrictions. This does not increase the Max. Item Bonus or Influence of the Capital until the normal Level requirement is met. In addition, the Capital’s influence is minimum 1.
