Bridges give settlements that have water borders a connection to land (but at the GM's option, a border on a lake might not be able to use bridges).

**Effects** A bridge allows an island settlement to provide influence (see [Influence](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1830)), negates the Trade penalty for island settlements (see [Land Borders](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1821)), and allows travel over its associated Water Border with ease (see [Navigating an Urban Grid](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1822)). Bridges can only be built on Water Borders. When you build a bridge, check the “Bridge” box on one of the Water Borders on your Urban Grid to indicate its location.
