### **Residential Lots and Overcrowding**: 
While almost every structure presumably includes a small amount of lodging, you need to build Residential lots in order to give your citizens enough places to live. You do so by building a structure that has the Residential trait in a chosen lot. Settlements require a number of Residential lots equal to the number of blocks that have any structures built within them, although these residential lots need not be located one per block. For example, when a village expands to a town, it initially occupies 2 blocks. It needs 2 Residential lots in total among those 2 blocks, either both in one block or one in each block. A settlement without this minimum number of Residential lots is Overcrowded (mark the “Overcrowded” box on your Urban Grid) and generates 1 Unrest for the kingdom during the [[Upkeep Phase]] of each Kingdom turn.
