A settlement's exact population is intentionally left abstract, but if you wish to estimate the numbers, you can use the values here as guidelines. Population density increases as a Settlement grows. In a village, each completed lot has an average population of 100 people or less. A town's average population increases to 125 people per completed lot, whereas a city's average population per lot increases to around 700. A metropolis can have an average population per completed lot of 1,000 people or more.
