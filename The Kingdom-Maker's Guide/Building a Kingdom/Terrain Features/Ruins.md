Ruins in a hex consist of a partially destroyed structure, often one that has been claimed by bandits, monsters, or other inhabitants. If you [[Claim Hex|Claim]] and [[Clear Hex|Clear]] a hex with Ruins in it, you can thereafter use what remains of the Ruins as the basis of an appropriate type of Settlement structure (as indicated by the encounter text), reducing the cost of that structure by half.
