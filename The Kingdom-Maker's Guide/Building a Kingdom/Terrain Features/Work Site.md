A Work Site generates commodities each Kingdom turn once you establish it via Establish Work Site. A Work Site established in a regular hex generates 1 Lumber, 1 Stone, or 1 Ore, depending on what type of site it is. Unlike most features, a Work Site can be constructed in a hex that already features a Resource, provided the Work Site is focused on harvesting that specific Resource. A Work Site established in a Resource hex doubles its Commodity production to 2. Work Site Commodities accumulate during the [[Upkeep Phase]] of a Kingdom turn. Some kingdom events can result in Work Sites being destroyed. When that happens, the hex loses its Work Site status; to restore it, you must successfully perform the Establish Work Site activity on the hex during a future Kingdom turn.
