A Freehold is a special kind of Settlementâ€” one that's not part of your kingdom. It may be of any size, from a village to a city. If you can convince the locals that your leadership is worthy, they may choose to join your nation and become your citizens. Bringing a Freehold into a kingdom requires a successful [[Pledge of Fealty]] leadership action. When a new settlement joins a kingdom, immediately add that settlement and its structures to the kingdom (as detailed in the encounter text). The kingdom gains no XP for any improvements already built there. Any future improvements built there grant normal XP awards.
