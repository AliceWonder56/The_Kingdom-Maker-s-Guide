These Terrain Features can overlap with any and all other features: Bridge, Landmark, Refuge, Resource

A hex can have at most one of these: Farmland, Freehold, Ruins, Settlement, Structure, Work Site. Weâ€™ll call this the Restricted list.

A Settlement can be built in a hex that contains Ruins or a Structure. The Ruins/Structure are incorporated into the Settlement and once a Settlement is built the hex ceases to have the Ruins or Structure feature. 

A Free Hold can be brought into your kingdom in which case it becomes a Settlement instead. 

To switch between any of the Terrain Features in the Restricted list the existing Feature must first be removed with the [[Clear Hex]] Activity before the new Terrain Feature can be constructed.
