No Farmland hexes exist in the Stolen Lands at the start of Kingmaker; they must be created by the PCs via the [[Establish Farmland]] activity. Each Farmland hex reduces a kingdom's [[Consumption]] score by 1, provided the Farmland lies in the area of influence of one of its settlements. Settlements cannot be built in a Farmland hex. Some kingdom events can result in Farmland being destroyed. When that happens, the hex loses its Farmland status. To restore it, a PC must successfully use the Establish Farmland activity on the hex during a future Kingdom turn.
