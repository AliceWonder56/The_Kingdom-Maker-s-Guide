A Landmark is a site of great pride, mystery, or wonder, such as an outcropping in the shape of a human face, a supernaturally ancient tree, or a lake with an unusual color. Adding Landmarks to a kingdom inspires its artists and bolsters kingdom morale. When the PCs add a Landmark hex to a kingdom, reduce Unrest by 1d4, and until the end of your next Kingdom turn, all Culture- and Economy-based skill checks gain a +2 circumstance bonus. When a kingdom claims its first Landmark hex, it gains 40 kingdom XP as a [[Milestones|milestone award]]
