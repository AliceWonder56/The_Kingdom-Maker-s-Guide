The army is in a defensive position as the result of a [[Garrison Army]] activity. While fortified, enemy armies cannot engage the army and the army cannot engage enemy armies. A fortified army gains a +4 item bonus to its AC and to Morale checks made to [[rally]]. A fortified army that uses a #Maneuver war action immediately loses its fortified condition.
