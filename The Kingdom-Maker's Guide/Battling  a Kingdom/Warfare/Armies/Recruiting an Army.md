#### Step 1: Choose a Basic Army Type
(Skip this step when recruiting a specialized army—its type is listed in its stat block.) Choose the basic type of army you want to recruit from [[infantry]], [[cavalry]], [[skirmishers]], or [[siege engines]]. 
  
You cannot choose an army whose minimum level is higher than your current kingdom level.

---
#### Step 2: Recruit the Army
Take the [[Recruit Army]] activity during the Leadership Activities step of a Kingdom turn to recruit the army.

---
#### Step 3: Adjust Statistics
When you recruit an army, its level adjusts to match your kingdom level. Unless you recruit an army at minimum level when your kingdom is the same level, this means you must adjust the army's DCs and check modifiers as detailed under [[Army Level Modifiers]].

---
#### Step 4: Choose initial Tactics
All armies can know at least one tactic. When you recruit a basic army, choose its tactics from any that it qualifies for (but note [[Cavalry|cavalries]] and [[siege engines]] “spend” their first tactic on Overrun and Engines of War respectively). Specialized armies already have one or more tactics listed in their stat blocks; you only add tactics to these armies after they increase their level.

---
#### Step 5: Place The Army
A basic army starts in the same hex as one of your kingdom's settlements. A specialized army starts in the hex in which you first encountered and recruited them. A settlement can support any number of armies.

---
#### Step 6: Adjust Consumption
When you recruit an army, your kingdom's [[Consumption]] score increases by the army's Consumption score. You don't have to pay [[Food Commodities]] for the army immediately, but you will need to do so during the [[Upkeep phase]] of your next Kingdom turn.

---
#### Step 7: Name the Army
Give your army a unique name and decide on any other flavorful elements for the army at this time if you wish. While the quality and magical nature of gear affects your army's statistics, the specific weapon and armor types do not.
