Your skirmishers are experts at ambushing. On the first round of a war encounter, if your turn occurs before any enemy army turns, you can choose to start the encounter with your army already [[Engaged]] with an enemy army whose initiative result is lower than yours. If you do so, your army gains a +2 status bonus on the first [[Attack]] [[War action]] they make against that army on the first round of the encounter.
