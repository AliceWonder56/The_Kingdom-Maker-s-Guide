Your army is skilled at surrounding their foes and distracting them, at the cost of spreading out too much and being more vulnerable. When you use the [[Advance]] war action to successfully [[Engaged|engage]] an army, you can choose to take a â€“2 circumstance penalty to your AC in order to gain a +1 circumstance bonus on attack rolls. If you do so, these modifiers remain in effect until you are no longer engaged. You can use the [[Outflank]] tactical war action.
