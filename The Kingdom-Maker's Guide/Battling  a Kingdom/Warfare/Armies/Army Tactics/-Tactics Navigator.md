When you recruit a basic army, choose its initial tactics from the following list; when you recruit a specialized army, it may already know tactics from this list in addition to its own unique tactics. Armies can learn new tactics using the Train Army activity. To qualify for a tactic, the army's level must be greater than or equal to that tactic's level, and the army's type must be listed as a trait for that tactic. An army cannot have a single tactic more than once.
