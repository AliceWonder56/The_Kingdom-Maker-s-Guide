When your kingdom gains a level, each army gains a level as well, increasing its stats as detailed on [[Army Level Modifiers]]. When an army increases its level, it may also increase the maximum number of tactics it can know—these new tactics are not gained automatically, but must instead be learned through the use of the [[Train Army]] activity.

#### Leveling Specialized Armies:
As with basic armies, specialized armies immediately adjust upward in level to match the level of the PCs’ kingdom, but unlike basic armies, the DCs and checks for specialized armies have different baselines. In stat blocks for specialized armies, the DCs and modifiers are given for that army at its minimum level, followed by an adjustment value in parenthesis. When the PCs recruit a specialized army at a level above its minimum, calculate its DCs and modifiers by starting with the values for a basic army of that level from the table on page 63 then applying the adjustment values given here.
