An army equipped with _healing potions_ (these rules are the same if you instead supply the army with alchemical healing elixirs) can use a single dose as part of any Maneuver action. When an army uses a dose of healing potions, it regains 1 HP. An army can be outfitted with up to 3 doses of healing potions at a time; unlike ranged Strike shots, healing potion doses do not automatically replenish after a war encounterâ€”new doses must be purchased.
