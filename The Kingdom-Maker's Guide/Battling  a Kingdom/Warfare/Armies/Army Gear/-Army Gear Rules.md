When you recruit a new army, it's outfitted with basic gear. The exact nature of this gear is largely cosmeticâ€” an infantry army armed with longswords will do the same potential amount of damage as one armed with clubs or spears or scythes. You can upgrade an army's gear by taking the [[Outfit Army]] activity.  
  
If you outfit an army with a type of gear the army is already outfitted with, the new gear replaces the old gear; if you spent RP on the old gear, you can deduct that RP cost from the cost of the new gear.

# Transferring Gear
You may transfer gear from one army to another, provided the army receiving the gear is high enough level to utilize the gear in question, and provided both armies are located in the same hex. This transfer does not require an activity to perform, but it must take place during Downtime.  
  
If an army with gear is [[destroyed]], all of its gear is destroyed. If an army with gear is disbanded, you can transfer its gear to another army as part of the Disband Army activity; if you don't do so, the gear is lost.
