The army's weapons are magic. If the army has melee and ranged weapons, choose which one is made magic when this gear is purchased. You can buy this gear twiceâ€”once for melee weapons and once for ranged weapons. If you purchase a more powerful version, it replaces the previous version, and the RP cost of the more powerful version is reduced by the RP cost of the replaced weapons.
