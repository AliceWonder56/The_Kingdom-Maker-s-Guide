Your army uses trickery, deception, and unfair tactics to attempt a devastating attack against an [[outflanked]] army. Attempt a melee Strike or a ranged Strike against the AC of a target [[outflanked]] army that is not distant.  
  
**Critical Success** The target army becomes [[Weary|weary 2]] until the start of your next turn.  
**Success** The target army becomes [[Weary|weary 1]] until the start of your next turn.  
**Critical Failure** Your attack deals no damage to the target army, which is emboldened by your failed attempt at dirty fighting. This reduces the target army's [[weary]] value by 1.
