Everyone has a place and a role, and as long as those roles are filled, the government functions. When you select this feat, choose one leadership role; that role is now supported by your efficient civil servants, so its vacancy penalty is no longer applicable. If you wish to change the leadership role to which Civil Service applies, you can do so using the [[New Leadership]] activity at the start of a Kingdom turn.  
  
You gain a +2 status bonus to New Leadership checks.
