At the start of each Kingdom turn, if any leader has not spent the required week of downtime in that role (see [[Leadership Roles]]) since the end of the last Kingdom turn, they must either give up one of the three activities they would take during the Leadership Activities step of the Activity phase, or apply this penalty until the start of the next Kingdom turn. (When the vacancy penalty ends, any Unrest generated by the vacancy remains in place and must be ameliorated in the normal fashion.) Vacancy penalties also apply to leadership roles that are unassigned.
