On your first Kingdom turn, your kingdom’s Unrest score is 0; skip to the next step.

On all other turns, adjust your [[Unrest]] score: Increase it by 1 for every settlement in your kingdom that’s Overcrowded (page 48). If you are at war, increase it by 1. Other ongoing events may have ongoing Unrest adjustments as well; make them at this time.

After making all adjustments, if your kingdom’s Unrest is 10 or higher, the kingdom gains 1d10 points to its [[Ruin|Ruins|]] (page 38). Distribute these points in any way you wish among the four Ruins. In addition, attempt a DC 11 flat check. On a failure, one hex of your kingdom is lost; the PCs choose which hex. See Losing Hexes on page 40 for more information.

If your kingdom’s Unrest is 20 or higher, the entire nation also falls into anarchy. While in anarchy, you can only attempt Quell Unrest activities, and the results of all kingdom checks are worsened one degree.
