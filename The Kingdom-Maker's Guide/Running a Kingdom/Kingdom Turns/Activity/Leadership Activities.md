If your kingdomâ€™s capital has a Castle, Palace, or Town Hall, each PC in a leadership role may attempt up to three [[L.A. Navigator|Leadership activities|]] (This link leads to the full list within the vault). If your capital has none of these structures, each PC can take no more than two Leadership activities during this step.

Your party chooses the order you go in when taking Leadership activities. Unless an activity
states otherwise, a leader cannot attempt the same Leadership activity more than once per Kingdom turn.
