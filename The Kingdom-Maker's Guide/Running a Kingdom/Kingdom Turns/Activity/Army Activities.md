After the PCs complete the [[Civic Activities]] step of a Kingdom turn, they may take an Army Activities step, in which each army currently maintained by the kingdom may take a single [[-A.A. Navigator|Army activity]]. The order in which they are attempted is chosen by the players. Army activities are presented below, and may only be taken during the Army Activities step (but note that [[Recruit Army]] is a [[-L.A. Navigator|Leadership activity]] instead).
