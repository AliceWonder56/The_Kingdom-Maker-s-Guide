#### Requirements: The army is in the same hex as a [[Refuge]], [[Settlements]], or [[Work Site]] 

You move an army into a fortification and assign them to guard it. If you're garrisoning the army in a Refuge hex, attempt a basic [Defense](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=21) check. If you're garrisoning the army in a settlement, attempt a basic [Politics](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=28) check. If you're garrisoning the army in a Work Site hex, attempt a basic [Engineering](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=22) check. This check's DC increases by 5 if the hex is not part of your kingdom, or by 10 if the location is part of an enemy kingdom.  
  
**Critical Success** The army becomes [[Fortified]] until it is deployed. Additionally, the efficiency of the garrisoning reduces this army's Consumption by 2 (to a minimum of 1) until it is deployed.  
**Success** The army becomes fortified until it is deployed.  
**Failure** The army becomes fortified until the next Kingdom turn begins, at which point you must use this activity again to maintain the fortified condition.  
**Critical Failure** Your army clashes with local citizens, abuses their authority, lets their watchful readiness slack, and/or provokes confrontations where they are not needed. It does not become fortified, and you cannot attempt to garrison that army at this location again for 4 Kingdom turns. Increase Unrest by 1.
