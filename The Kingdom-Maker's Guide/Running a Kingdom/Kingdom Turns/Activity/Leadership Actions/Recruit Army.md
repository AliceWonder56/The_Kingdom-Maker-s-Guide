Note that you pursue this activity during the Leadership step of the Activity phase. Either you recruit an army from your kingdom's citizens, or you secure the allegiance of a specialized army you encountered in the Stolen Lands. If you're recruiting an army from your kingdom's citizens, choose one of the [[B.A. Navigator|basic armies]] and attempt a [Warfare](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=32) check against the army's Recruitment DC. If you're securing a specialized army, you must attempt a [Statecraft](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=30) check against the Recruitment DC; statistics for these armies appear starting on page 571.  
  
**Critical Success** You recruit the army; it becomes [[efficient]].
